# Job recommender via natural language processing
## 1. Overview
The project is done during the last three weeks of Data Science Bootcamp at WBS Coding School. The idea of project is to help job seekers to find right jobs based on their CV.

Three popular platforms for job search is used for collecting data:

- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/)
- [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.de/)
- [Indeed](https://de.indeed.com/)

For my purpose, I only focus on jobs which are related to Data.

Tech stacks: **selenium, deep translator, text extraction, spacy, natural language processing, recommender system**.
